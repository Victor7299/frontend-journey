# My forntend journey 
This has to be my repository that contains my projects in this (little) adventure call Frontend. I really hate doing css.

I'm more into backend development, I know Python and my favorite (micro)framework is Flask so for the styling I use Pico CSS or Bootstrap.
I always wanted to learn frontend but I hate CSS so much. May I'm using Tailwind later.
